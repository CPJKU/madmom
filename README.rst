madmom
======

Madmom is an audio signal processing library written in Python.

The library is used internally by the Department of Computational Perception,
Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (http://www.cp.jku.at) and the
Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria
(http://www.ofai.at).

Possible acronyms are:

- Madmom Analyzes Digitized Music Of Musicians
- Mostly Audio / Dominantly Music Oriented Modules

It includes reference implementations for some music information retrieval
algorithms, please see the `References`_ section.

License
=======

The package has two licenses, one for source code and one for model/data files.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

To install the ``madmom`` package, you must have either Python 2.7 or Python
3.3 or newer and the following packages installed:

- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
- `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
- `cython <http://www.cython.org>`_
- `nose <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose>`_ (to run the tests)

If you need support for audio files other than ``.wav`` with a sample rate of
44.1kHz and 16 bit depth, you need ``ffmpeg`` (``avconv`` on Ubuntu Linux has
some decoding bugs, so we advise not to use it!).

Please refer to the `requirements.txt <requirements.txt>`_ file for the minimum
required versions and make sure that these modules are up to date, otherwise it
can result in unexpected errors or false computations!

Install from package
--------------------

The easiest way to install the package is via ``pip`` from the `PyPI (Python
Package Index) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_:

    pip install madmom

This includes the latest code and trained models and will install all
dependencies automatically. It will also install the executable scripts to a
common place (e.g. ``/usr/local/bin``) which should be in your ``$PATH``
already. ``pip`` will output the install location.

You might need higher privileges (use su or sudo) to install the package, model
files and scripts globally. Alternatively you can install the package locally
(i.e. only for you) by adding the ``--user`` argument:

    pip install --user madmom

Depending on your platform, the scripts will be copied to a folder which
might not be included in your ``$PATH`` (e.g. ``~/Library/Python/2.7/bin``
on Mac OS X or ``~/.local/bin`` on Ubuntu Linux), so please call the scripts
directly or add their path to your ``$PATH`` environment variable:

    export PATH='path/to/scripts':$PATH

Install from source
-------------------

If you plan to use the package as a developer, cloning the Git repository is
the best option, e.g.:

    git clone https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.git

Since the pre-trained model/data files are not included in this repository but
rather added as a Git submodule, you either have to clone the repo recursively:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.git

or init the submodule and fetch the data manually:

    cd /path/to/madmom

    git submodule update --init --remote

You can then build and install this package by running:

    python setup.py build

    python setup.py install

You might need higher privileges (use su or sudo) to install the files to a
common place like ``/usr/local`` or similar. Alternatively you can install the
package locally by adding the ``--user`` argument:

    python setup.py install --user

To run the included tests:

    python setup.py test

Install for development
-----------------------

If you want to actively work on the package, please follow the git cloning
instructions from the `Install from source`_ section.

You can then either include the package directory in your ``$PYTHONPATH``,
e.g. by the following command (if your are in the directory containing this
``README`` file):

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH

or you can install the package in development mode:

    python setup.py develop

If you are not using the development variant or if you change any ``.pyx`` or
``.pxd`` files, you have to (re-)compile some modules with Cython. To do so,
please run:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Again, you can install the package locally by adding the ``--user`` argument:

    python setup.py develop --user

To run the included tests:

    python setup.py test

Package structure
-----------------

The package has a very simple structure, divided into the following folders:

`/bin <bin>`_
  this folder includes example programs (i.e. executable algorithms)
`/madmom <madmom>`_
  the actual Python package
`/madmom/audio <madmom/audio>`_
  low level features (e.g. audio file handling, STFT)
`/madmom/evaluation <madmom/evaluation>`_
  evaluation code
`/madmom/features <madmom/features>`_
  higher level features (e.g. onsets, beats)
`/madmom/ml <madmom/ml>`_
  machine learning stuff (e.g. RNNs, HMMs)
`/madmom/models <madmom/models>`_
  pre-trained model/data files (see the License section)
`/madmom/utils <madmom/utils>`_
  misc stuff (e.g. MIDI and general file handling)
`/tests <tests>`_
  tests

Almost all low level features (i.e. everything under
`/madmom/audio <madmom/audio>`_) are divided into a data class and a
corresponding processor class. The data class refers always to a certain
instance (e.g. the STFT of an audio file), whereas the processor classes are
used to define processing chains through which the audio is processed (i.e.
most stuff in `/madmom/features <madmom/features>`_).

Executable programs
-------------------

The package includes executable programs in the `/bin <bin>`_ folder.
If you installed the package, they were copied to a common place.

All scripts can be run in different modes: in ``single`` file mode to process
a single audio file and write the output to STDOUT or the given output file.

    SuperFlux single [-o OUTFILE] INFILE

If multiple audio files should be processed, the scripts can also be run in
``batch`` mode to write the outputs to files with the given suffix.

    SuperFlux batch [--out OUTPUT_DIR] [-s OUTPUT_SUFFIX] LIST OF INPUT FILES

If no output directory is given, the program writes the output files to same
location as the audio files.

The ``pickle`` mode can be used to store the used parameters to be able to
exactly reproduce experiments.

Please note that the program itself as well as the modes have help messages:

    SuperFlux -h

    SuperFlux single -h

    SuperFlux batch -h

    SuperFlux pickle -h

will give different help messages.

Note
----

Although we try to keep the API stable, the features are considered work in
progress and thus can change without prior notice. Do *NOT* expect these to
stay the same forever! If you need stable features, clone or fork this project,
set the parameters accordingly and/or pickle the processors.
