Introduction
============

Madmom is an audio signal processing library written in Python with a strong
focus on music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. The project is on `GitHub`_.

It's main features / design goals are:

* ease of use,
* rapid prototyping of signal processing workflows,
* most things are modeled as numpy arrays (enhanced by additional methods and
  attributes),
* simple conversion of a workflow to a running program by the use of
  processors,
* no dependencies on other software packages (not even for machine learning
  stuff),
* inclusion of reference implementations for several state-of-the-art
  algorithms.

Madmom is a work in progress, thus input is always welcome.

The available documentation is limited for now, but :ref:`you can help to
improve it <write_documentation>`.
