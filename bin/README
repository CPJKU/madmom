This folder contains executable scripts, which make use of all the nice things
included in this package. Most of them can be run in the following way:

bin/name_of_script.py INFILE [OUTFILE]

There should be an `--help` option which describes all the other options.

The scripts should be considered as examples of usage, which can change without
prior notice. Do NOT rely on any feature output of these scripts! If you need
stable features, create a branch and set all parameters accordingly.

Since some of the scripts are used directly for the annual MIREX evaluation,
tagged branches reflecting the settings of these submitted algorithms should be
created. 

If you get segfaults on Mac OS X systems, please check if numpy and scipy use
ATLAS instead of Apple's own Accelerate framework or use the '--threads 1'
switch.
