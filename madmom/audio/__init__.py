"""
This package includes audio handling functionality and low-level features.
The definition of "low" may vary, but all "high"-level features (e.g. beats,
onsets, etc. -- basically everything you want to evaluate) should be in the
`madmom.features` package.

Notes
-----
Almost all functionality blocks are split into two classes:

1) A data class: instances are signal dependent, i.e. they operate directly on
   the signal and show different values for different signals.
2) A processor class: for every data class there should be a processor class
   with the exact same name and a "Processor" suffix. This class must inherit
   from madmom.Processor and define a process() method which returns a data
   class or inherit from madmom.SequentialProcessor or ParallelProcessor.

The data classes should be either sub-classed from numpy arrays or be indexable
and iterable. This way they can be used identically to numpy arrays.
