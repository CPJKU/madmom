class TransitionModel(object):
    """
    Transition model class for a HMM.

    The transition model is defined similar to a scipy compressed sparse row
    matrix and holds all transition probabilities from one state to an other.
    This allows an efficient Viterbi decoding of the HMM.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : numpy array
        All states transitioning to state s are stored in:
        states[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]]
    pointers : numpy array
        Pointers for the `states` array for state s.
    probabilities : numpy array
        The corresponding transition are stored in:
        probabilities[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]].

    Notes
    -----
    This class should be either used for loading saved transition models or
    being sub-classed to define a specific transition model.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.sparse.csr_matrix

    Examples
    --------
    Create a simple transition model with two states using a list of
    transitions and their probabilities

    >>> tm = TransitionModel.from_dense([0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1],

    >>> tm  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <madmom.ml.hmm.TransitionModel object at 0x...>

    TransitionModel.from_dense will check if the supplied probabilties for
    each state sum to 1 (and thus represent a correct probability distribution)

        Compute the forward variables at each time step. Instead of computing
