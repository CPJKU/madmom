class TransitionModel(object):

    Transition model class for a HMM.

    The transition model is defined similar to a scipy compressed sparse row
    matrix and holds all transition probabilities from one state to an other.

    All states transitioning to state s are stored in:
    states[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]]

    and their corresponding transition are stored in:
    probabilities[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]].

    This allows for a parallel computation of the Viterbi path.

    This class should be either used for loading saved transition models or
    being sub-classed to define a specific transition model.
