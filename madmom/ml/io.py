"""
This file contains functionality needed for the conversion of from the
universal .h5 format to the .npz format understood by madmom.ml.rnn.

The .h5 files must conform to this format:

The `model` group contains just attributes.
  - `type`:    the type of the model
  - `comment`: free text for comments (optional)

The `layer` group contains a subgroup for each layer.

The subgroups are numbered consecutively, starting at index zero.

Each layer subgroup contains the following attributes:
  - `type`: the type of the layer
Each layer subgroup can contain the following data sets:
  - `bias`:              bias of the layer
  - `weights`:           weights of the layer
  - `recurrent_weights`: recurrent weights (optional for recurrent layers)
  - `peephole_weights`:  peephole weights (optional for LSTM layers)

Each of the previous layer subgroups can contain the same named data sets with
a 'reverse_' prefix to indicate that they belong to the reverse/backward layer
of bidirectional layers.
