Unless indicated otherwise, all files are published under the license which can
be found in the LICENSE file.

All features can change without prior notice. Do NOT expect these to stay the
same forever! If you need stable features, create a branch and set the needed
parameters accordingly.

To use this package without installing it, make sure this directory is in your
$PYTHONPATH.

However, better performance can be expected when using cython to compile
speed critical parts:

python setup.py build

To install the package, simply run: 

python setup.py install

You might need higher privileges (use su or sudo) to install the files to a
common place like '/usr/local' or similar.

The package is designed to have as few as possible external requirements,
usually only numpy and scipy is required. If you get segfaults on Mac OS X
systems, please check if numpy and scipy use ATLAS instead of Apple's own
Accelerate framework or use the '--threads 1' switch where appropriate.
